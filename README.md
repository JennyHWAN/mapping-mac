# Note
In order to run the bash file inside the `.py` file: inside the target dir and run `chmod +x file_name.sh` for example: `chmod +x delete.sh` to give the file authentication. But not applicable on win.

I wanted to create error handling message that could appear in popup window, but haven't success. My thought: could use backend js code or use bootstrap, but the current bootstrap I added and comment out is shown behind my nav bar and cannot show the X button to close it. So current version of error handling is now manual page to show error msg.

## In Order To Run
python server.py
